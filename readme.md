### Dates

    - Assigned: 07/07/2024
    - Due: Sunday July 21 23:59:00 PDT 2024

## Goals ##

- C++: OOP, with highlights to:
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Constructors
  - Templates, and
  - Operator overload
- C++: working with floating point number (float and double).
- Work with memory (allocate and delete)
- Learn to use ChatGPT to study.

### Problems To Solve

There are **FIVE** problems to solve. Please find the description of the first 2 problem in their own page:

- [Problem 1](problem_1.md) (25pt)
- [Problem 2](problem_2.md) (25pt)
- [Problem 3](problem_3.md) (30pt)
- [Problem 4](problem_4.md) (10pt)
- [Problem 5](problem_5.md) (10pt)

Tasks to do are marked by "TODO" in comments in the ***src*** and ***test*** folders. In Clion, these can be viewed in the TODO window:

### Code Repo ###

Use the following repo for homework:

**Code:** https://github.com/a-teaching-goose/2024-summer-342-hw-2 

Not using this repo will result in 0 point.

General requirements (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Do not create any new file or delete existing file in the repo. The grader bot checks for this.
- Do not make modification to any file outside the ***src*** and ***test*** folders.
- Do not make modification to any file unless specificially allowed (usually marked with "TODO" in comments).

### Code Correctness ###

Your code is as correct as what the Github PR tests prove, and looks for the double green check marks as below in PR grader bot result. It means the PR is good enough for submission, but it doesn't mean there's no more room to improve.

### Work Instruction ###

Follow [this guide](https://github.com/a-teaching-goose/CSS342A-2024-Summer/blob/main/homeworks/work_guide.md).

### Notes ###

- Start early. Be active. Ask questions, especially if you are stuck on anything for longer than 2 hours.
- Partial credits will be given. If you cannot finish some part, add comments describing your thinking.
- OK to search the web or ask AI for help. Give credits in your code if you use any.
- Homework is to be done by yourself. Okay to discuss with others. 
- Late submission without proper approval by the teacher will result in **ZERO** point.  
- Read grader and teacher's code review comments. Be open to accept them for improvement but be prepared to defend your choice. 

### Code of Conduct

Plagarism will not be tolerated and will receive **ZERO** point, this includes (but not limited to)

- Copy others' code line by line.
- Copy online resources line by line, with or without giving credits.

Offense will be reported to the department.

I will not be able to catch all the cheats, and frankly, it could hurt nobody but yourself. Here's some reason why [you shouldn't cheat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMloyp6NI4E).
